\begin{frame}[fragile]{Compiler divergence}

 Compile this program with \verb/-O2/, and the compiler hangs!

\begin{alltt}\Large
import Data.Vector as V
reverseV = V.foldl (flip (:)) []
\end{alltt}

(Use GHC $<$ 7.7)

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Dot product}
The code we want to write
\begin{alltt}\Large
dotp :: Vector Int -> Vector Int -> Int
dotp as bs
  = fold    (+) 0
  $ zipWith (*) as bs
\end{alltt}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Dot product}
The code we want to run
\begin{alltt}\Large
dotp as bs = go 0 0
 where
  go i acc
   | i > V.length as
   = acc
   | otherwise
   = go (i + 1) (acc + (as!i * bs!i))
\end{alltt}
No intermediate vectors, no constructors, no allocations: perfect.

(Just pretend they're not boxed ints...)
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Dot product}
The code we get after stream fusion (trust me)
\begin{alltt}\Large
dotp as bs = go \oomph{(Nothing,} 0\oomph{)} 0
 where
  go (_, i) acc
   | i > V.length as
   = acc
  go (Nothing, i) acc
   = go (\oomph{Just} (as!i)\oomph{,} i\oomph{)} acc
  go (Just a, i) acc
   = go \oomph{(Nothing,} i + 1\oomph{)} (acc + (a * bs!i))
\end{alltt}
All those allocations!
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Dot product}
The code we get after stream fusion (trust me)
\begin{alltt}\Large
dotp as bs = go (Nothing, 0) 0
 where
  go \oomph{(}_\oomph{,} i\oomph{)} acc
   | i > V.length as
   = acc
  go \oomph{(Nothing,} i\oomph{)} acc
   = go (Just (as!i), i) acc
  go \oomph{(Just} a\oomph{,} i\oomph{)} acc
   = go (Nothing, i + 1) (acc + (a * bs!i))
\end{alltt}
Only to be unboxed and scrutinised immediately. What a waste.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Dot product}
Let us try specialising this by hand.
\begin{alltt}
dotp as bs = \oomph{go (Nothing, 0) 0}
 where






  go (_, i) acc
   | i > V.length as  = acc
  go (Nothing, i) acc = go (Just (as!i), i) acc
  go (Just a,  i) acc = go (Nothing, i+1) (acc + (a*bs!i))
\end{alltt}
Start by looking at the first recursive call.
We can specialise the function for that particular call pattern.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Dot product}
Let us try specialising this by hand.
\begin{alltt}
dotp as bs = \oomph{go'1 0 0}
 where
  \oomph{go'1 i acc = case i > V.length as of
   True  -> acc
   False -> go (Just (as!i), i) acc}



  go (_, i) acc
   | i > V.length as  = acc
  go (Nothing, i) acc = go (Just (as!i), i) acc
  go (Just a,  i) acc = \oomph{go'1 (i + 1) (acc + (a * bs!i))}
\end{alltt}
Specialise on \verb/go (Nothing, x) y = go'1 x y/
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Dot product}
Let us try specialising this by hand.
\begin{alltt}
dotp as bs = go'1 0 0
 where
  go'1 i acc = case i > V.length as of
   True  -> acc
   False -> \oomph{go (Just (as!i), i) acc}



  go (_, i) acc
   | i > V.length as  = acc
  go (Nothing, i) acc = go (Just (as!i), i) acc
  go (Just a,  i) acc = go'1 (i + 1) (acc + (a * bs!i))
\end{alltt}
Now look at the call in the new function. We can specialise on that pattern, too!
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Dot product}
Let us try specialising this by hand.
\begin{alltt}
dotp as bs = go'1 0 0
 where
  go'1 i acc = case i > V.length as of
   True  -> acc
   False -> \oomph{go'2 (as!i) i acc}
  \oomph{go'2 a i acc = case i > V.length as of
   True  -> acc
   False -> go'1 (i + 1) (acc + (a * bs!i))}
  go (_, i) acc
   | i > V.length as  = acc
  go (Nothing, i) acc = go (Just (as!i), i) acc
  go (Just a,  i) acc = go'1 (i + 1) (acc + (a * bs!i))
\end{alltt}
Specialise on \verb/go (Just x, y) z = go'2 x y z/
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Dot product}
Let us try specialising this by hand.
\begin{alltt}
dotp as bs = go'1 0 0
 where
  go'1 i acc = case i > V.length as of
   True  -> acc
   False -> go'2 (as!i) i acc
  go'2 a i acc = case i > V.length as of
   True  -> acc
   False -> go'1 (i + 1) (acc + (a * bs!i))
  \oomph{go (_, i) acc
   | i > V.length as  = acc
  go (Nothing, i) acc = go (Just (as!i), i) acc
  go (Just a,  i) acc = go'1 (i + 1) (acc + (a * bs!i))}
\end{alltt}
Now it turns out that \verb/go/ isn't even mentioned any more. Get rid of it.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Dot product}
Let us try specialising this by hand.
\begin{alltt}
dotp as bs = go'1 0 0
 where
  go'1 i acc = case i > V.length as of
   True  -> acc
   False -> \oomph{go'2 (as!i) i acc}
  go'2 a i acc = case i > V.length as of
   True  -> acc
   False -> \oomph{go'1 (i + 1) (acc + (a * bs!i))}




\end{alltt}
These two are mutually recursive, but we can still inline \verb/go'2/ into \verb/go'1/.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Dot product}
Let us try specialising this by hand.
\begin{alltt}
dotp as bs = go'1 0 0
 where
  go'1 i acc = \oomph{case i > V.length as of}
   True  -> acc
   \oomph{False -> case i > V.length as of}
      True  -> acc
      \oomph{False ->} go'1 (i + 1) (acc + (as!i * bs!i))





\end{alltt}
The case of \verb/i > V.length as/ is already inside the False branch of a case of the same expression,
we can remove the case altogether.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Dot product}
Let us try specialising this by hand.
\begin{alltt}
dotp as bs = go'1 0 0
 where
  go'1 i acc = case i > V.length as of
   True  -> acc
   False -> \oomph{go'1 (i + 1) (acc + (as!i * bs!i))}







\end{alltt}
Which was what we wanted.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{ForceSpecConstr}
SpecConstr puts a limit on the number of specialisations,
as too many specialisations causes code blowup.
\begin{alltt}
unstream :: Stream a -> [a]
unstream (Stream f s) = go \oomph{ForceSpecConstr} s
 where
  go \oomph{ForceSpecConstr} s
   = case f s of
     Done       -> []
     Skip    s' ->      go \oomph{ForceSpecConstr} s'
     Yield a s' -> a :  go \oomph{ForceSpecConstr} s'
\end{alltt}

But with stream fusion, such as in the \verb/vector/ library, we want to specialise everything no matter what.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{ForceSpecConstr termination}
A nasty bug in ForceSpecConstr meant that specialising on recursive types would produce infinite specialisations.

\begin{alltt}
reverse :: [a] -> [a]
reverse as = go ForceSpecConstr as []
 where
  go []     acc = acc
  go (a:as) acc = \oomph{go as (a:acc)}

SPECIALISE \oomph{go as (a:acc)}:
go'1 as a acc
 = case as of
    [] -> (a:acc)
    (a':as') -> \oomph{go as' (a':a:acc)}

SPECIALISE \oomph{go as' (a':a:acc)}:
go'2 as' a' a acc
 = ...
\end{alltt}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{ForceSpecConstr termination}
This is fixed simply by limiting specialisation on recursive types a fixed number of times (\verb/-fspec-constr-recursive/).

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Seeding of specialisation}
Looking at the function body, there are many call patterns to specialise.

\begin{alltt}
go :: Either (Maybe Int) (Maybe Int) -> Int
go c = case c of
 Left   a ->
    go $ Right a
 Right  Nothing ->
    go $ Left Nothing
 Right (Just a) ->
    go $ Left (Just (a-1))
\end{alltt}

There are three patterns here to specialise on. After specialising, we get two more patterns.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Seeding of specialisation}
If it is a local, non-exported function, we are much better off starting specialisation with calls from the current module.

\begin{alltt}
go :: Either (Maybe Int) (Maybe Int) -> Int
go c = case c of
 \oomph{Left   a ->
    go $ Right a}
 \oomph{Right  Nothing ->
    go $ Left Nothing}
 Right (Just a) ->
    go $ Left (Just (a-1))

main =
 putStrLn $ \oomph{go $ Right Nothing}
\end{alltt}

Here, we produce only two specialisations: initially \verb/Right Nothing/, and then \verb/Left Nothing/.
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}[fragile]{End}
end.
\end{frame}
