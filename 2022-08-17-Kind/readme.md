# Model-checking techniques for reactive systems.

Slides from a talk on model-checking.
This explains basic techniques of translating streaming programs to a transition system, and then proving properties using induction and k-induction.

The slides are here for historical completeness, but the annotated SMT-lib script in [model-checking.smt] is more self-contained.
