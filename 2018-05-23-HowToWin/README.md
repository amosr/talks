Talk at FP-Syd 2018-05-23: "How to win your first Coq Fight"

# Abstract

The annual Sydney Coq Fight is next month (June), and already you can hear the hushed whispers of anticipation wherever you walk. The cityfolk are amazed that such a thing could exist.

"An interactive theorem proving tournament, right here in my own city?"

Some scoff at this improbability; others are befuddled beyond belief. But, in this case, the facts are indisputable. The Coq Fight is real, with competitors racing to prove theorems in a head-to-head rush. Stress-blind competitors take trivial lemmas about appending lists, and prove them in non-trivial ways.

Tonight, we shall see how to prove these trivial lemmas, both on paper, and in Coq. With a month to prepare, there is plenty of time for you to become this year's Ultimate Coq Master.

# Slides

This was an interactive talk using CoqIde so the slides aren't very useful on their own.
The slides go through a simple proof using a kind of butchered mixture of natural deduction and sequent calculus to make them fit the Coq tactics slightly better.
The idea was just to get people used to looking at proof trees and seeing the mechanical application of rules on paper.

I was originally going to talk about an experience report of using Hs-to-Coq, but had trouble proving anything interesting with termination conditions.
There are some unfinished hs-to-coq proofs in `./src`.
